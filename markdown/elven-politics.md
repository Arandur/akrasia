# Elven Politics

The [elven race](elven-race) comprises one unified nation, governed by a council
of eight wizards known officially as the First Council after the Order of
[Denali](gods#denali), colloquially as the First Council or the High Council.
Each council seat is associated with one of the eight schools of magic.

The members of the First Council are held to be the greatest teachers of
wizardry -- not necessarily the greatest or most powerful wizards themselves.
Council members hold their seats for [life](elven-race#lifespan) or until
ousted by a successful challenge.

## History

The First Council was established and received its mandate and authority from
Denali at the Dawn of the [First Age](first-age), at the [Genesis
Moot](genesis-moot), three hundred years ago.
